<h1>About me</h1>

Experienced Telephone Interviewer with a passion for Cyber Security, software, and web development. I am currently studying at Exeter College within the field of Computing. I have a keen interest in blue and red skillsets within cyber security. Looking for any experience within the field to enhance my skills and take my learning further. Ever since I was young, I have been intrigued by how computers work and what makes them tick after receiving my first computer. With an inquisitive mind, I began to question everyday things that most people take for granted, e.g., how pixels move across a screen. This interest led me to take apart many electronics to find out how they work, even if it meant breaking them in the process. As a result of this fascination, I chose Computer Science as one of my A-levels to which I learned a great deal about computer systems that run our world. During my A-levels, I took part in the government-funded scheme Cyber Discovery whereby my interest in computers flourished into an enthusiasm of security, but due to my A-level commitments, I could not find the time to finish the scheme. After completing my A-levels, I did not pursue cybersecurity at university level but instead decided to take my time to explore if this is a career path which I would be interested in, which led to me choosing to progress further through an Higher National Certificate in Computing and subsequently the Higher National Diploma.
